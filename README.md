# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Face Recognition Attendance system built using python programming language and storing data, database used was MySQL. The Algorithm used to create this project was Haar Cascade and  LBPH algorithm.
Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects or patterns within digital images or video.The Haar Cascade algorithm is particularly popular for detecting faces in images and is commonly used in applications such as face recognition, face tracking, and facial expression analysis.
LBPH stands for Local Binary Patterns Histograms. It is a texture-based image descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for tasks like face recognition, texture classification, and object recognition. LBPH is particularly popular in face recognition applications due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
